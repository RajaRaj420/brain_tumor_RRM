Git Hub Workflow:-

# Make changes in dev
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin dev

# Pull latest from main before starting new dev work
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout dev
git merge main


1️⃣ Everyone clones the repository

Each developer will clone the repo to their local machine:

git clone https://github.com/RajaRaj420/brain_tumor_RRM.git
cd brain_tumor_RRM

2️⃣ Set up branches for collaboration

main → Always production-ready.

dev → Integration branch; everyone pushes feature branches here first.

feature/<feature-name> → Each developer creates their own branch for a specific task.

Example:

# Make sure you are on dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# Create a personal feature branch
git checkout -b feature/mri-upload-handler

3️⃣ Work locally

Make code changes, add new files, edit SRS/docs, etc.

Commit frequently with clear messages:

git add .
git commit -m "Add MRI upload validation API"

4️⃣ Push your feature branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/mri-upload-handler


The -u sets the upstream, so next time you can just do git push.

5️⃣ Open a Pull Request (PR)

Go to your GitHub repo.

You’ll see your branch has been pushed and GitHub suggests opening a PR.

Set base branch = dev and compare branch = your feature branch.

Add reviewers, assign labels, and submit the PR.

6️⃣ Code Review & Testing

Reviewers look at the code and leave comments.

Changes can be requested and re-pushed to the same feature branch.

Once approved, merge the PR into dev, not main.

7️⃣ Integration Testing on dev

Other developers pull the updated dev branch locally:

git checkout dev
git pull origin dev


They can test integration with their local setup.

8️⃣ Merging dev into main

After dev is stable and passes tests, create a PR:

base branch = main
compare branch = dev


After review and approval, merge to main.

Optionally, tag a release on main for production-ready snapshots.

9️⃣ Daily workflow summary per developer
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev           # update dev

git checkout -b feature/<name>
# do work, commit changes
git push -u origin feature/<name>

# open PR to dev on GitHub
# review/merge

✅ Tips for Smooth Multi-Developer Workflow

Never push directly to main. Always use feature/<name> → dev → main.

Pull frequently: Avoid conflicts by pulling dev before starting new features.

Use descriptive commit messages: Helps reviewers understand changes.

Use GitHub token for HTTPS auth: Each dev generates their own fine-grained token.

Optional: Enable branch protection on main and dev in GitHub settings:

Require PR review before merging

Require status checks (tests)
