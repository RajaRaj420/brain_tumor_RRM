Git Workflow Cheat-Sheet for the Brain Tumor Project
1️⃣ Clone the repo (first time only)
git clone https://github.com/RajaRaj420/brain_tumor_RRM.git
cd brain_tumor_RRM

2️⃣ Always work on a feature/dev branch

Don’t work directly on main.

Create a personal or feature branch:

git checkout main          # make sure main is up to date
git pull origin main       # pull latest changes
git checkout -b dev        # create dev branch
# OR for new features: git checkout -b feature/my-feature

3️⃣ Make changes and commit
# Check what’s changed
git status

# Add changes
git add <file1> <file2>   # or git add . for all

# Commit with meaningful message
git commit -m "Add GitHub workflow notes"


⚠️ Important: Never commit secrets (tokens, passwords, API keys). Keep them in .env or use secret managers.

4️⃣ Push dev/feature branch to GitHub
git push -u origin dev
# OR for feature branch: git push -u origin feature/my-feature


GitHub will now recognize this branch.

You can open a Pull Request (PR) for code review.

5️⃣ Create Pull Request (PR)

Go to GitHub → your repository → Pull Requests → New Pull Request.

Select dev (or feature branch) as source and main as target.

Review the diff:

Make sure no secret files are included.

Code looks correct.

Add reviewers (teammates) if needed.

Click “Create Pull Request”.

6️⃣ Merge PR after approval

Once approved and CI/tests pass:

Click “Merge pull request” → “Confirm merge”.

Pull latest main locally:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

7️⃣ Update local dev branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin main    # bring main changes into dev


This keeps your branch up-to-date and avoids conflicts later.

8️⃣ Remove sensitive files

If a secret accidentally gets committed:

git rm --cached <file>     # remove file from git but keep locally
git commit -m "Remove sensitive file"
git push origin dev


For old commits containing secrets, use git filter-repo
 on a fresh clone.

✅ Key Rules for the Team

Never push directly to main – always use branches + PRs.

Secrets go in .env, never in git.

Pull before you push – avoid conflicts.

Use descriptive commit messages – easier PR reviews.

Feature branches can be deleted after merging.

Workflow Steps Using Diagram

Clone repo → start on main.

Create dev branch → do shared development here.

Create feature branches → for specific tasks or experiments (feature/login, feature/ML).

Commit changes locally → never commit secrets.

Push feature branch → open PR to dev.

Merge approved PR into dev → dev always has the latest validated code.

Once dev is stable, open PR to main → main is now production-ready.

Tip: Each teammate works on their own feature branch → dev is shared → main is protected.
